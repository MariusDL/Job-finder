# Project Name
Job-finder

# Project Description
Android app where users can post or find jobs in their area. It is a personal project so I can learn using the google maps API.

# Project Features
- Two types of users: normal users and workers
- Login, register, automatic authentication
- All users have a my account section where they can update personal details
- Users can add a job that include an image, job type,  description, due date,  money offered, location.
- Workers can search for jobs in a specific area or around their current location, and they can select a distance range
- Workers can select which types of services they offer, and in the search list they will find only jobs specific for their qualifications.
- Once a job is done, the user that posted the job can complete it on the app and it goes to jobs history on the user and worker account
- Once a job is accepted, the user and the worker can contact each other by phone call
- Worker can launch google maps from the app to navigate to the job location
- A worker can cancel a job that he accepted and the job goes back to the pending list
- The user that posted the job can cancel it only if the job has not been accepted by a worker
